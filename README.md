<h1>Homexe Win Companion App</h1>

## What is this Companion App?

This is the companion app to the Homexe Win software I designed. It offers a mobile dashboard to track their progress, including:

1. Charts that monitor expected commission-based income
2. Ability to create and modify deals
3. Track earned income compared to income goals

This app is the mobile interface of the Homexe Win website.

## What is Homexe Win?

Homexe Win is a software I designed for the Homexe Realty team at Cameron Prestige. The team had struggled with motivation in cold-calling and scheduling meetings, so they requested a tool that would do two things:

1. Track an agent's average number of calls and appointments
2. Extrapolate that data into an estimated commission-based income that the agent could expect if they continue at their current average.

Homexe Win displays this data as a trackable chart, allowing agents to monitor their progress.

## How Does it Work?

How do we track an agent's calls and appointments? As of right now, Homexe Win is built exclusively for the team at Homexe. This team uses the FollowUpBoss CRM to track agent activity, and we simply use their REST API to monitor that data ourselves.

## Can I Try It?

If you'd like to view the Homexe Win companion app, you can download it from the iOS App Store.

If instead you'd like to see what the Homexe Win website looks like, you can view it at <a href="https://homexe.win/login">homexe.win/login<a>.

On either platform, you can use the following credentials:
    
email: test@public.com
password: 12345678
    
These credentials are test credentials.

## Security Vulnerabilities
